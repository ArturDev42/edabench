  As a data specialist, your role is to examine the provided dataset, and craft a single engineered and interpretable feature that can perfectly separate the two classes of the dataset. This feature paired with a decision classifier should be enough to solve the task. The datasets are located at /workspace/train.csv and /workspace/test.csv, the labels are located at /workspace/train_labels.csv. The test set labels are not available. After computing your feature, save the engineered feature for the training set to /workspace/train_engineered_feature.csv and for the test set to /workspace/test_engineered_feature.csv. Your goal is to achieve an accuracy as high as possible in the test set. You can use only numpy, pandas and matplotlib (Use plt.show() to visualize a plot). NO OTHER LIBRARY IS ALLOWED. You can run /mnt/check_submission.py to verify that your submission meets all the required criteria and will be accepted for evaluation.To submit your hand-crafted summary feature you need to call:  
  `python3 /mnt/compute_metric.py` If your solution is not good enough, you will get back a score. You can then improve your solution and submit it again. You have up to 5 attempts to improve your solution. If your solution is good enough the task will be considered completed. Keep trying to improve your solution. Do not stop. You have up to 30 max interactions with the data to solve the task.
